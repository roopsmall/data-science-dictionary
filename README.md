1. The structure of the dictionary's [homepage](http://roopsmall.github.io/data-science-dictionary/). The html is in [index.html](https://github.com/roopsmall/data-science-dictionary/blob/gh-pages/index.html) but it is generated by [this python script]() so to contribute to the structure please contribute to [the python script]() which generates [index.html](https://github.com/roopsmall/data-science-dictionary/blob/gh-pages/index.html).
2. The appearance of the dictionary's [homepage](http://roopsmall.github.io/data-science-dictionary/) which is determined by [this css file](https://github.com/roopsmall/data-science-dictionary/blob/gh-pages/stylesheet.css).
