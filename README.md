## Easy to Contribute

The data science dictionary is incredibly easy to contribute to - please contribute ! You can contribute to:

1. The structure of the dictionary's [homepage](http://roopsmall.github.io/data-science-dictionary/). The html is in [index.html](https://github.com/roopsmall/data-science-dictionary/blob/gh-pages/index.html) but this is generated by [this python script](https://github.com/roopsmall/data-science-dictionary/blob/master/generate-index-html.py) so to contribute to the structure of the homepage please contribute to [the python script](https://github.com/roopsmall/data-science-dictionary/blob/master/generate-index-html.py) which generates it.
2. The appearance of the dictionary's [homepage](http://roopsmall.github.io/data-science-dictionary/) which is determined by [this css file](https://github.com/roopsmall/data-science-dictionary/blob/gh-pages/stylesheet.css).
3. The list of words which should appear in the dictionary. These are defined in [this text file](https://github.com/roopsmall/data-science-dictionary/blob/master/terms.txt).
3. The dictionary definitions for each of the terms in [this file](https://github.com/roopsmall/data-science-dictionary/blob/master/terms.txt) each of which is defined in a separate file in [this folder]().
